Michael,Andrade,Dancing Feather,2018,781-704-7662,michael.m.andrade@gmail.com,"3/16""=1'",Kit,21,5,19,"The Dancing Feather was one of the first pilot boats designed by Dennison Lawlor while he was an apprentice in a shipbuilding firm in East Boston. She was built in 1853 and measured 67’ 6” in length and 19’ 8” in width, carrying about 3000 square feet of sail. Shortly after she was sent to San Francisco.","The model is built from the AJ Fisher kit, with some modifications added. The most obvious addition is the sails, along with copper sheathing as individual plates. This model represents approximately 200 hours of work.",,,
Alex,Bellinger,Archibald Russell,2018,978-462-2715,shipinbottler@gmail.net,"6""=61'",Scratch,8,3.5,3.5,"The Archibald Russell was built in Scotland in 1905 and has become a classic example of the type of ship built for the last generation of sailing trade.  Built of steel, she was intended to hold up for years carrying bulk cargo long distances around the globe.  Though not designed for speed, the Archibald Russell and ships like her were capable of making good passages and giving dependable service at a relatively low cost.  The wind was still cheaper than coal. But they were still edged out by the steamers and were especially vulnerable to the new dangers of the World Wars, these old windjammers were all but gone by the middle of the 20th Century.","This ship is a familiar choice for ship in bottle builders.  Started many years ago, this model was set aside waiting for just the right bottle.  It finally came, in this hand blown bottle by a Cape Cod glass blower.  Though a close fit, this little Archibald Russell seems well suited to her home.   ",,,
Alex,Bellinger,Carl Vinnen,2019,,,"1"" =61'",Scratch,8.25,4,4,"The Carl Vinnen was one of the five “Vinnen” ships built by the Krupp shipyard in Germany for general cargo transportation in the 1920s.  Constructed from steel, with a registered weight of 1827 tons, these ships were rigged as topsail schooners, but the mounting of topsails only on the first and third of their five masts was unique.  Early historians were critical of these ships, mostly because of their unusual appearance, but also because their sailing performance was not good; these points were evidential in suggesting that the experimental rig was not a success.  Although one of the ships (the Adolf Vinnen) was wrecked on her maiden voyage, the remaining four had long and successful careers as cargo carriers.  The Carl and Susanne Vinnen were still carrying their original rigs in the 1940s.","The unusual rig makes an interesting ship in bottle and, judging from other examples known to the modeler, a popular choice.  This model is made of pine and bamboo, with limited attempts at finer detail considering the small scale.  The sails are cigarette paper and most of the rigging line is fly tying threads.",,,
